Krill is a flexible, privacy-first automation system designed for home automation, IoT projects, and process control. It runs on Linux devices—including Raspberry Pi—and connects them into a secure, peer-to-peer mesh network without requiring cloud services or an internet connection.

## What Krill Can Do

- **GPIO and Hardware Control** — Connect to sensors, relays, solenoids, and other hardware via Raspberry Pi GPIO pins
- **Logic Gates and Automation** — Build automation workflows using configurable logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, BUFFER) that respond to sensor inputs and conditions
- **Time-Series Data Points** — Collect and store sensor data with millisecond-level precision for monitoring and analysis
- **Flexible Scheduling** — Schedule tasks with second-level precision using built-in cron timers
- **Peer Mesh Networking** — Connect multiple Krill servers together securely over your local network with automatic peer discovery and self-healing connections
- **Python Lambdas** — Execute custom Python scripts on your server with input/output integration for unlimited flexibility
- **MQTT Support** — Connect to thousands of third-party sensors and devices, including Zigbee2MQTT for smart home integration
- **Serial Device Communication** — Interface with Arduinos, QTPy boards, and other microcontrollers
- **Cross-Platform Apps** — Control your system from Android, desktop, or web interfaces
